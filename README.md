# Web-Scraping-Twitter
A simple program built in Python to web scrape twitter without adhearing to Twitter's API limitations

Twitter has a public API that allows users to scrape data from twitter based on either username or hashtag. 
This API only lets a user scrape hashtag data from the last week and wont scrape anything beyond that.

This program is designed to allow a user to grab hashtag data from twitter from a specifed date range.
The user can then save the data into a .csv for further analysis in R, Excel, Python, or another program.

Instuctions on how to custom fit this to your specific needs are in the code annotations in both the Jupyter Notebook and standard Python file.
